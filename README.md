# Wrangling and Analyze Data

## Introduction
Project to perform all the three steps in data wrangling, that is, gathering, assessing and cleaning.

The second part of the project was to analyze and visualize the clean data.

All datasets were from [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). 

## Data Wrangling 
**Gathering**
Three datasets were gathered through three different methods.
* Download manually and read into a pandas dataframe.
* Download programmatically
* Application Programming Interface (API)

**Assessing**
The three datasets was assessed to check and document the data quality and tidiness of the data.

The issues were searched in two ways:
- Visually
- Programmatically

**Cleaning**
In the final step in Data wrangling, cleaning, all quality and tidiness issues documentated was fixed.

The cleaning was done programmatically.

In the cleaning stage, the issue was _Defined_, _Code_ was written to fix the issue and _Test_ was connducted to ascertain whether the issue was fixed or not.

**Visualize**
The data was further analyzed and visualized to derive some insights.

## Prerequisities
The libraries used for this project are:
- panda, numpy and matplotlib
- requests
- tweepy
- wordcloud
